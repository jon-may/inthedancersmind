The two data files FinalOverallData and FinalOverallDataLong contain the same data.
One is Wide, with three sessions per row (Cab1a, Cab2a, Cab3a)
The other is Long, with a Session variable and all data under the Cab1 variables.

The 'annotated syntax reproducing results in paper' files contain the Results section and SPSS syntax to recreate the results.
The files will need to be read into SPSS, saved, and the paths in the syntax file corrected to match your file structure.
